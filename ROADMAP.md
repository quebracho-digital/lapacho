# Lapacho — Roadmap

Lapacho: secure clipboard manager (Tauri 2 + Rust). Libre core; classifies,
sanitizes and masks content before it reaches the UI. **The `raw_content` is
the source of truth and is never lost:** it is copied and sent to plugins
intact, *rendered* sanitized, and on export threats are reported without
altering it.

## Current Status (2026-06-22)
History search implemented; English translation of docs + key source strings complete.

### ✅ `lapacho-core` (lib, 45 unit + integration tests)

- `types` — `ClipboardItem` (raw) / `UIClipboardItem` (safe projection) + enums.
- `detectors` — type classification (text/url/json/svg/mermaid/markdown).
- `security` — sanitization (text + SVG) and sensitivity classification (regex + entropy).
- `ingest` — pipeline that composes everything + display masking.
- `storage` — **abstraction `HistoryRepo`** (trait) over SQLite (WAL); persistence
  levels, **configurable sensitive TTL** (`RetentionPolicy`), size cap and
  **content-based dedup** (recopying moves to top, no duplicate — no cleartext hash).
- `crypto` — **AES-256-GCM at rest**; `SecretKey` (zeroize) + resident `Cipher`
  (boxed, zeroize, optional mlock via `mlock` feature).
- `threats` — **modular scanner** (trait `Detector` + `REGISTRY`): active-content,
  embedded-frame, trojan-source-bidi, zero-width, control-chars, sensitive-data,
  prompt-injection. Adding a filter = one struct + one line.
- `plugins` — execution of external commands via stdin, with timeout.

### ✅ Desktop backend (`apps/desktop/src-tauri`)

- Clipboard monitor (`arboard`, 500 ms) → `process_text` → `HistoryRepo`.
- Encryption key in **OS keyring** (Secret Service / Keychain / Credential
  Manager) with `0600` file fallback and automatic migration.
- Memory hardening: key `mlock` + no core dumps (Linux `prctl`).
- Commands: `get_history`, `delete_item`, `clear_history`, `get/set_persist_level`,
  `get/set_sensitive_ttl`, `copy_item` (raw), `export_item` (raw + threats),
  `list_plugins`, `run_plugin` (operates on raw; output is stored as new item).
- Live event `clipboard-new` (reactive refresh — old `://` bug is resolved).

### ✅ Frontend (`apps/desktop/ui` — Leptos 0.7 / WASM, verified build with Trunk)

- **Standalone** crate (excluded from workspace; Trunk compiles it to wasm32). Does
  not depend on `lapacho-core`: **mirror types** of the safe projection.
- Typed bindings over `window.__TAURI__` (`invoke` / `listen`).
- Live list, copy/delete/clear, persistence and TTL selector.
- Per-item actions: **maximize** (full view), **export** (shows raw + detected
  threats before writing), **send to plugin**.
- The original vanilla UI is preserved as reference in `apps/desktop/legacy-ui/`.

## Pending

### 🎨 Frontend / UX

- [x] **System tray (native menu) + global shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L, Lapacho-exclusive), launching
  only to tray** (`src-tauri/src/tray.rs`). The list is a native indicator menu
  (fluid, no webview), rebuilt debounced on every change. The tray *indicator icon*
  now dynamically shows the thumbnail of the most recent (top) item when it is an
  image (falls back to default). Base app icon is a custom artistic design (Argentine
  blue halo + dark green hexagon + lapacho leaf/circuit + golden nodes) generated from
  `icons/lapacho-source.svg`. *Needs real GUI testing.* Deferred: auto-paste (`enigo`),
  cursor popup, and per-item icons for non-images. (dynamic + new artistic icon 2026-06-22)
- [x] Per-`detected_type` rendering in the maximize modal (Raw/View toggle):
  **SVG** (via `<img data:>`, not innerHTML — safer), **Markdown**
  (`pulldown-cmark`), **JSON** (pretty), **Mermaid** (live diagram with vendored
  `mermaid.min.js`, strict mode, degrades to source). Needs GUI testing.
- [x] **Rich rendering in the list** (improved): MD mini, now also SVG as <img> thumb (safe data url), JSON small pretty. Images use display PNG thumb + "Image (N bytes)" label with peso. Thumbnail + size fields now flow to UI. Mermaid source visible (full render heavy for list). See app.rs. (2026-06-22)
- [x] **Maximize modal uses more space**: widened modal (max 820px), raised preview limits to ~65-70vh for diagrams/images/SVG/MD/code (was 40-50vh). Full resizable/maximized would need additional UI (e.g. drag or dedicated window). See index.html. (2026-06-22)
- [x] History search / filtering: server-side (raw+display, case-insensitive) via `HistoryRepo::search` + tauri cmd + Leptos input. Secrets match on raw even when display is masked. Client list stays live. (2026-06-22)
- [x] Image support: capture `get_image()`, PNG data-URL + 18×18 thumbnail
  (`src-tauri/src/images.rs`), `<img>` in list/modal and **per-item icon in the
  tray**, paste back with `set_image`. Needs GUI testing.
- [ ] Optimize wasm for release (`trunk build --release`; currently ~2.9 MB
  unoptimized after adding markdown/json/base64). Note: `mermaid.min.js` ~3.2 MB
  is a separate JS asset (not inside the wasm).

### 🐛 Bugs & Reactivity (HIGH PRIORITY — do in a dedicated session)
- [ ] **SVG does not render** ("svg no se renderiza") — investigate where (modal, list, tray preview?). Add to roadmap as-is; fix later.
- [ ] **Reactivity / live updates still not fully resolved** ("todavia no resolvimos la reactividad") — UI list and/or native tray sometimes miss new clipboard items or lag after copy/delete. Previously had partial fixes (tray_recent volatile + spawn_local). **Raised priority**; tackle with focused debugging + tests.
- [ ] Distinguish sensitive/secret items: when multiple credentials or secrets are copied, they all show as "•••• [secret]" (or similar) making it impossible to tell them apart in the list or tray. Show some safe partial info (e.g. last few chars for tokens, or type hint) so they are identifiable. Add to roadmap.

### 🔐 Security

- [ ] Replace the regex SVG sanitizer with a real parser (`ammonia`) — TODO in
  `security.rs`.
- [ ] More detectors in `threats::REGISTRY` (SQL injection, advanced XSS) — the
  modular registry already supports this without touching `assess()`.
- [ ] Real-machine verification of keyring + mlock (not testable headless).

### 📦 Project

- [ ] `LICENSE-APACHE` (standard text copy) before publishing — the dual
  `MIT OR Apache-2.0` is already declared and `LICENSE-MIT` exists.
- [ ] Decide whether to version `apps/desktop/src-tauri/gen/` (generated capabilities).

**Recent decision:** Global shortcut changed from Ctrl+Shift+V (too common in terminals, editors, browsers) to **Ctrl+Shift+Alt+L** (Lapacho-exclusive). Updated in code, README, HANDOFF, ROADMAP and CONTEXT.

## We do not use

- **Nothing from Diodon** or other GTK/Vala managers: our own architecture (Rust +
  Tauri 2, UI-free core). The only conceptually comparable thing is "recent list
  in the tray", which is implemented using Tauri's tray API.
